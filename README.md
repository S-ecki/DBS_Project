# SQL_Project
 
In this project, I built a database a chosen domain from scratch. <br/>
It was created for my class [Datenbanksysteme](https://ufind.univie.ac.at/de/course.html?lv=051031&semester=2020W) at the University of Vienna.

The Project was split up into several parts:

## Entity Relationship Diagram


## Relational Schema


## SQL Script on Oracle


## Java + JDBC


## PHP + Bootstrap
